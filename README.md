# how to run the node container

Be sure that you have installed docker

Run 
`make build` - this command create a image

By default, the image will have this name `nddev:<commit hash>`

You can override this behaviour by running command with arg:

`make build tag=<specify the name>`
It produces the name `nddev:<name>`

There are two predefined variants how to run that container:

`make run` and `make run-shell`

First just start nodemon as usual and watches changes
Second attach the shell (you can run commands inside container)


The folder `src` is attached to the container
